Another approach to managing your passwords - cross platform

Instead of permanently storing them - along with the websites / logins you store with the passwords anyway..

You just input some metadata and a master password - then generate a password on the fly and store it nowhere.

Each time the same password.

Password reset? Increase password sequence number.
